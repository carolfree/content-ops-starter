        subtitle: Carol Christina Tozer
        text: >
          With over 30 years of experience homeschooling five children, I have
          supported education in various ways, including developing curriculum
          and directing and/or assisting in educational programs in the
          community. My focus has always been on fostering confidence,
          independence, and a love for learning. For nearly a decade, I have
          also worked as an emotional healing practitioner, helping adults and
          children overcome challenges and experience personal transformation.
          My interests include public speaking, theater, outdoor education,
          nature photography, and volunteering with seniors, reflecting my
          passion for creativity, lifelong learning, and meaningful community
          connection.
